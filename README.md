# soil_moisture_modeling

This is a repository for using GAMs to model seasonal soil moisture in sorghum fields to see the effect of adding cover crop.

Briefly, we are interested in seeing how rainfall and drying events effect fields with cover crop (rye) and fields without cover crop. More to follow later.
